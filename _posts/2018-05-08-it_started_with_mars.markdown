It started with a student's question. How do space probes get sent to Mars? 

Ever since I was young, I have always been fascinated by space exploration. However, we didn't have a space program in the Philippines, so I buried my dream of working for the space industry. 

Years later, I'm a high school Math teacher at a public school in Washington DC, and a student's question rekindled my interest in space. What started as a lesson on quadratic equations representing parabolic flights, ended up with me researching dozens of articles on how millions of lines of code are responsible for launching, maneuevering and maintaining space probes. 

The more I read and researched about space probes, the more I became interested in what made them tick. I never paid attention to code before. In my computer classes in high school, I was never the computer whiz. But I remember being fascinated by the mechanisms of programming--how each command was responsible for executing something. It amazed me how something as simple as a line of code, can do astounding things like launch a rocket into space or maneuver Curiosity Rover in MARS. 

I then began attending our school's Girls Who Code programs. Seeing my students learn how to code made me interesetd in learning it myself. I started re-learning some of the languages I learned in high school (HTML, CSS and C++). I found the free Bootcamp prep course of the Flatiron school, when I was trying to find free courses online. Pretty soon I got hooked. 

To top it off, I got excited when I found out that the Flatiron School offered scholarships for women. When I was growing up, careers in technology were not the path girls were encouraged to pursue in the Philippines. I was not exposed to the world of tech, so for someone like me who loved Math and competed nationally, I thought the only option was to teach. I am not surprised that women are underrepresented in the technology or engineering industry. So I was very impressed that women's scholarships to pursue programming existed. Without hesitating, I dove in. 

I applied and interviewed with one of the admissions counselors, and before you know it, I got the scholarship! I never looked back. 

So in this little space on the web, is where I chart my road to code. I hope you enjoy reading!
